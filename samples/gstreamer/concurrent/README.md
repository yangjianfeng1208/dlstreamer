# Concurrent use of DL Streamer and DeepStream

This sample detects hardware and runs pipelines using DL Streamer and/or DeepStream.

## How it works

1. Using intel/dlstreamer:2026.0.0-ubuntu24 image, the sample downloads yolov8_license_plate_detector and ch_PP-OCRv4_rec_infer models to \./public directory if they were not downloaded yet.
2. Using nvcr.io/nvidia/deepstream:8.0-samples-multiarch image it downloads deepstream_tao_apps repository to \./deepstream_tao_apps directory. Then downloads models for License Plate Recognition (LPR), makes a custom library and copies dict.txt to the current directory, in case deepstream_tao_apps does not exist.
3. Hardware detection depending on setup
- Run pipeline simultaneously on both devices for:
  - both Nvidia and Intel GPUs
  - Nvidia GPU and Intel NPU
  - Nvidia GPU with Intel CPU
- Run pipeline directly per device for:
  - Intel GPU
  - Nvidia GPU
  - Intel NPU
  - Intel CPU

## How to use

```sh
./concurrent_dls_and_ds.sh <input> LPR <output>
```

- Input can be rtsp, https or file.
- License Plate Recognition (LPR) is currently the only pipeline supported.
- Output is the filename. For example parameter: Output.mp4 or Output will create files Output_dls.mp4 (DL Streamer output) and/or Output_ds.mp4 (DeepStream output). 

## Notes

First-time download of the Docker images and models could take a longer time.
